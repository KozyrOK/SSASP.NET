<pre> Task: To simulate the work of the Service station.
        The following types of vehicles can be serviced at the Service station:
        - passenger car;
        - truck;
        - bus.
        The service station diagnoses the following nodes:
        - car bodes;
        - wheels;
        - engines;
        - brakes;
        - undercarriages;
        - hydraulics (only for truck);
        - handsrails (only for bus).
        For each listed node there is a current state from 0 to 100 points (100 points - new,
    0 points - not working). Additional services (at the request of the client):
        - wheel balancing for passenger car;
        - changing the upholstery of the seats in the cabin for bus.
        It is necessary:
    - to evaluate the general condition of the vehicle (arithmetic mean for all nodes);
    - consider the cost of repair and repair every detail;
    - The form on which you can register a arrived car, state it each detail, show the general 
condition, the cost of repairs, indicate additional services and display "To pay X $".

    Task solution: This web application is the solution to the task described above.
